# PascalCompiler
This is a pascal front-end compiler. Made for college compiler class. 

This project consists of:

- Parser (Lexical Analyzer)
- Syntactic Analyzer 

This project is not optimized, it was implemented with the intention to make the code closest to theoretical compiler concepts and state machines as possible.
